# Block Storage

## Definition
Block storage involves storing data in fixed-sized blocks, commonly used in high-performance applications like databases and virtual machines.

## Use Cases
Block storage is ideal for workloads requiring fast access to raw storage and low latency, such as:
- Databases
- Virtual machines (VMs)
- Transactional systems

## Protocols
Common block storage protocols include:
- iSCSI
- Fibre Channel (FC)
- SAS

## How it Works
In block storage, each block acts as an independent hard drive. The server's operating system manages the blocks, allowing the application direct access to the storage.
